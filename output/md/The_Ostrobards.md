# The_Ostrobards   
   
The Ostrobards are a relatively new addition to civilization, having given up their barbarian ways only in the last century. They are one of four distinct groups of humans in Blackmarsh. The largest Ostrobard settlement is **Muncaester**, ruled by [Duke_Caedwine](./Duke_Caedwine.md). Muncaester is located on an island situated where the Rednut River meets the River Eamont. It is a thriving marketplace where merchants from across the Grey Sea come to trade farm produce, furs, and exotic herbs.   
   
Another significant Ostrobard settlement is **Wedmor**, a center for cattle herding. Every fall, the herds are gathered, and most of the bulls and older cattle are butchered. The meat is then salted, sent down the Rednut River to Muncaester, and from there, distributed throughout the Blackmarsh region.   
   
The easternmost Ostrobard outpost is **Wessex Keep**, commanded by [Duke_Caedwine](./Duke_Caedwine.md)'s eldest son, Bedewald the Atheling. Wessex Keep protects the farms and villages to the west from the creatures that live in the Dragonbone Peaks.   
   
**Camden**, another Ostrobard settlement, is a mining town surrounded by iron mines to the west.
